        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Stir frying is a Chinese cooking technique in which ingredients are fried in a small amount of very hot oil while being stirred in a wok.</p>
            <p>The technique originated in China and in recent centuries has spread into other parts of Asia and the West.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Olive Oil</li>
                <li>Vegetables: red bell pepper, yellow bell peppers, sugar snap peas, carrots, mushrooms, broccoli, baby corn, water chestnuts.</li>
                <li>Sauce: soy sauce, garlic cloves (minced), brown sugar, sesame oil, chicken broth, cornstarch</li>
                <li>Garnish: green onions and sesame seeds</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <p>The first step is to cook up your veggies. I used a combination of red and yellow peppers, snow peas, broccoli, carrots, and mushrooms. I also added some baby corn and water chestnuts into the mix for variety. While the veggies are cooking, I make a simple garlic sauce. The sauce gets poured over the veggies then is simmered until thickened. You can enjoy your veggie stir fry as-is, or over rice.</p>
