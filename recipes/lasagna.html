        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Double the meat with both ground beef and Italian sausage. This will give you that extra flavoring from the Italian sausage but also the classic taste from the ground beef. Oh. SO.

Thick, wide lasagna noodles separates each layer and adds that soft buttery taste to the lasagna recipe.</p>
