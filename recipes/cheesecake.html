        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Graham cracker crumbs about 12 crackers: Crush them easily in a food processor if you have one. Or pound in a ziplock bag with a rolling pin.</li>
            <li>Sugar: White sugar adds just enough sweetness to the crust.</li>
            <li>Butter melted: This will combine the crust ingredients together and make them stick into the perfect crust.</li>
            <li>Pinch salt: This will balance the sweetness so do not leave it out.</li>
            <li>2 lbs cream cheese softened (4 8oz packages): I take out my cream cheese while I prepare and bake the crust, at least a good 30 minutes will do.</li>
            <li>Sour cream: Adds a beautiful tang to the cream cheese and lightens it so it is not too heavy.</li>
            <li>Sugar: Adds the sweet we all love.</li>
            <li>Eggs: Use room temperature eggs for the best results. Remove them from the fridge when you take out your cream cheese.</li>
            <li>Vanilla: Use a good quality vanilla for a rich flavor.</li>
            <li>Lemon zest: You are going to love the zing it creates.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>Simple and delicious, this buttery sweet crumb crust is the perfect bottom layer for New York Cheesecake!</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Prep: Preheat oven to 325. Prepare your springform pan by spraying with cooking spray, placing a parchment round on the bottom, and spraying the top of the parchment with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Combine: Mix graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter together. This should resemble damp sand.</li>
            <li>Press: Pour your crumb mixture into the prepared springform pan and press evenly into the pan. You can use the bottom of a flat glass or a flat measuring cup to really press it in well and get a nice, even crust.</li>
            <li>Cook: Bake for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cool: Allow cooling completely.</li>
        </ol>
